  abstract = {As a result of the increased emphasis on mis- and over-use of p-values in scientific research and the rise in popularity of Bayesian statistics, Bayesian education is becoming more important at the undergraduate level. With the advances in computing tools, Bayesian statistics is also becoming more accessible for undergraduates. This study focuses on analyzing Bayesian courses for undergraduates. We explored whether an undergraduate Bayesian course is offered in our sample of 152 high-ranking research universities and liberal arts colleges. For each identified Bayesian course, we examined how it fits into the institution’s undergraduate curricula, such as majors and prerequisites. Through a series of course syllabi analyses, we explored the topics covered and their popularity in these courses, and the adopted teaching and learning tools, such as software. This article presents our findings on the current practices of teaching full Bayesian courses at the undergraduate level. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for programs that may consider offering Bayesian courses to their students.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the thought processes involved in statistical problem solving in the broad sense from problem formulation to conclusions. It draws on the literature and in-depth interviews with statistics students and practising statisticians aimed at uncovering their statisticalreasoning processes. From these interviews, a four-dimensional framework has been identified for statistical thinking in empirical enquiry. It includes an investigative cycle, an interrogative cycle, types of thinking and dispositions. We have begun to characterisethese processes through models that canbe used asa basis for thinking tools or frameworks for the enhancement of problem-solving. Tools of this form would complement the mathematical models used in analysis and address areas of the process of statisticalinvestigation that the mathematical models do not, particularly areas requiring the synthesis of problem-contextual and statistical understanding. The central element of published definitions of statistical thinking is “variation”. We further discuss the role of variation in the statistical conception of real-world problems, including the search for causes.},

  abstract = {Data are abundant, quantitative information about the state of society and the wider world is around us more than ever. Paradoxically, recent trends in the public discourse point towards a post-factual world that seems content to ignore or misrepresent empirical evidence. As statistics educators we are challenged to promote understanding of statistics about society. In order to re-root public debate to be based on facts instead of emotions and to promote evidence-based policy decisions, statistics education needs to embrace two areas widely neglected in secondary and tertiary education: understanding of multivariate phenomena and the thinking with and learning from complex data.},

  title = {The {5E} {Instructional} {Model}: {A} {Learning} {Cycle} {Approach} for {Inquiry}-{Based} {Science} {Teaching}},
  abstract = {The implementation of inquiry-based teaching is a major theme in national science education reform documents such as Project 2061: Science for All Americans (Rutherford \& Alhgren, 1990) and the National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996). These reports argue that inquiry needs to be a central strategy of all science curricula. Using a learning cycle approach in the classroom helps to facilitate inquiry practices because learning cycles focus on constructivist principles and emphasize the explanation and investigation of phenomena, the use of evidence to back up conclusions, and experimental design. Although there are several variations of learning cycles, the one that is highlighted in this manuscript as a method to support inquiry-based teaching is the 5E Instructional Model (Bybee \& Landes, 1990). The use of this model in several science education professional development programs is also addressed.},
