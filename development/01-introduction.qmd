## Introduction

This activity is all about *statistical inference* and *statistical assumptions*.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the activity, ...

## Before We Begin...

Ask yourself the following questions:

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Warmup Questions"}
- What do you remember about analyzing a dataset with statistics?
- What do you know about frequentist and Bayesian statistics? (*Note*: It's ok if you don't know what this means!)
:::

Discuss these questions with the people at your table.

## The Big Idea: Inference

Statistical inference is drawing conclusions about **data we haven't seen** using **only the data that are available.** As a simple example, if we're interested in the energy burden pattern in Colorado but we only have data from Massachusetts, we should be careful when trying to use the MA data to predict patterns in CO. Crucially, **the assumptions we make for inference will strongly affect the conclusions we make.**

All statistical analyses involve making assumptions---we'll practice making and assessing statistical assumptions in this activity.
