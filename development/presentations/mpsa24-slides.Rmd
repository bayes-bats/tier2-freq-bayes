# Statistical Inference in Social Science Classrooms

- Traditional Frequentist methods (NHST) are taught in social science classrooms, particularly public policy and political science.

- Two considerations:
  1. Teaching quantitative methods alongside substantive theories is hard (Connelly et al. 2021; Gunn 2017; Bates & Jenkins 2007)
  2. Different methods produce different outcomes (Luque & Sosa 2023; Gill & Witko 2013)
  
- Bayesian methods provide an intutive, and perhaps more appropriate, approach for answering public policy questions (Gill & Witko 2013; Wagner & Gill 2005)

#  Statistical Inference in Social Science Classrooms

__The Big Idea:__ 

Introduce an applied learning activity for students of public policy
that exposes them to Bayesian methods + explores the differences between
this statistical paradigm and more commonly used approaches.

__Activity Learning Goals:__
1. Evaluate hypotheses with inferential statistical models
2. Connect (1) with real-world factors
3. Understand how Frequentists vs. Bayesian assumptions can lead to different conclusions

__Overall Goal:__

Engineer a “classroom controversy” to motivate students to find their own understanding of (3).
