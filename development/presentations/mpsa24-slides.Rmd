# Statistical Inference in Social Science Classrooms

- Traditional Frequentist methods (NHST) are taught in social science classrooms, particularly public policy and political science.

- Two considerations:
  1. Teaching quantitative methods alongside substantive theories is hard (Connelly et al. 2021; Gunn 2017; Bates & Jenkins 2007)
  2. Different methods produce different outcomes (Luque & Sosa 2023; Gill & Witko 2013)
  
- Bayesian methods provide an intuitive, and perhaps more appropriate, approach for answering public policy questions (Gill & Witko 2013; Wagner & Gill 2005)

#  Statistical Inference in Social Science Classrooms

__The Big Idea:__ 

Introduce an applied learning activity for students of public policy
that exposes them to Bayesian methods + explores the differences between
this statistical paradigm and more commonly used approaches.

__Activity Learning Goals:__
1. Evaluate hypotheses with inferential statistical models
2. Connect (1) with real-world factors
3. Understand how Frequentists vs. Bayesian assumptions can lead to different conclusions

__Overall Goal:__

Engineer a “classroom controversy” to motivate students to find their own understanding of (3).

__Context__

- Dataset: [Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST)](https://screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/en/#3/33.47/-97.5) 
  - Executive Order issued by President Biden in January 2021
  - U.S. Census tract level data on dozens of indicators

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

# Applied Activity: Comparing Frequentist & Bayesian Approaches

__Activity Closing__

- Students come together for a full class discussion about the conclusions they draw from their respective analysis.

- There's an apparent controversy here - students from the groups will have come to different conclusions.

- Students finish the activity by "jigsawing" and discussing the differences between general inference and model summaries for Frequentists and Bayesians.

# Evaluation

- Pre- and post-pre-survey designs were used to assess students' attitudes and awareness about statistical inference. 

- Goal: capture changes in self-perceived attitudes about a topic by asking them to consider where they think their beliefs were _before_ the activity, followed by where they think they are _now_ (Hiebert & Magnusson 2014).

```

---

# Evaluation

- Perceived attitudes about inferential statistics, both before and after the activity, were a bit of a mixed bag. 

- While the results for the Likert battery were "noisy", the open-ended responses were somewhat illuminating.

- More work to be done here...

.big[Discussion]

# Discussion

- Bayesian methods are another possibility that non-statistics disciplines should consider both in the classroom and in the wild.

- Using an applied, student-driven approach, this activity moves beyond simple comparisons by using an activity with a real-data application.

- Some evidence that the goal of equipping them with the tools & logical processes necessary to apply either approach as they see fit was met.

- Next steps
