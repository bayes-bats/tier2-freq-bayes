abstract: |
  Implementing quantitative methodological techniques is a crucial piece of understanding public policy. While quasi-experimental, spatial (diffusion), and mixed methods are most commonly used when teaching policy studies, little research exists on using Bayesian approaches for policy learning, or how the outcomes from traditional quantitative approaches differ from a Bayesian approach. We propose an applied learning activity for students of public policy that exposes them to Bayesian methods and explores the differences between this statistical paradigm and more commonly used approaches. We do this using a structured interrogation of the [The Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool](https://screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/en/) (CEJST) and the epistemological framings in the 5E model [@elby2010epistemological]. The activity illustrates the importance of statistical assumptions, and by extension, the impact that different quantitative methods have on understanding public policy. The goal of the study is to introduce students, instructors, and practitioners of public policy to a new way of using statistics, equipping them with the tool set and logical processes necessary to apply either approach as they see fit when studying public policy.

## Other notes
- Submitted to Sec. 72: Research on Teaching & Learning
- Second field listed as public policy
- Brief overview:
  - Students interrogate a public policy dataset and explore the differences between this paradigm and commonly used approaches. We evaluate its impact on statistical knowledge, highlighting results are conditional on the assumptions chosen for analyses.
