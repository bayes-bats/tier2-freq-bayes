## Activity Overview

In this activity, we learned more about *statistical inference* and *statistical assumptions* through the lenses of Frequentists and Bayesians. We used the [CEJST dataset](https://screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/en/) to understand general trends around sustainability and disadvantaged communities, as well as crafted specific research questions or hypotheses that we would like to rigorously test with the data we have. Our research question asked:

  | _Do Black Americans experience a disproportionate level of energy expenditure?_

And our primary hypothesis we wanted to answer is:

  | _As the population of Black Americans increases (decreases), the level of energy expenditure increases (decreases)._
  
To test this, we focused on the Energy Burden Percentile as our dependent variable and Percent Black Census Tract as our primary independent variable in our models. We examined some descriptive statistics to get a better sense of the trends in our data and to help us better understand the relationship between these two variables. 

Our initial exploration found that there is a clear positive trends between the population of Black Americans and the level of energy burden in their respective Census tract for Florida and Massachusetts. However, Colorado has a negative trend, which is somewhat surprising given the results of the other two states. The results from our exploratory analysis suggests there are inequitable outcomes between the states.

Based on these preliminary trends, we used statistical inference to answer our questions. Some students received an analysis completed in the Frequentist framework, while some students received an analysis completed in the Bayesian framework. 

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Questions for the Class"}
- How would you answer our research question now that we have analyzed the data?
- Did you find support for or against our hypothesis?
- What can we conclude about the relationship between sustainability and disadvantaged communities?

## Differences between Frequentist & Bayeisan Approaches

With the remainder of class time, separate into groups of 2-3 people, where each group should have at least 1 person who did the Frequentist analysis and 1 person who did the Bayesian analysis. Using the [Context Reference Guide](https://github.com/bayes-bats/tier2-freq-bayes/blob/main/development/00-context-main.qmd), discuss the following:

- How do our modeling choices affect our outcomes of interest based on the assumptions we know about both approaches? Are the results for our hypotheses different?
- How do we interpret the coefficients ($\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$) in both the Frequentist and Bayesian models?
- How might we improve our model based on what we know from our **model summaries** and **general inference** for both approaches?

Jot down 2-3 sentences for each question, as well as any remaining questions or concerns you have about conducting your analyses using one of the two approaches.
