## Differences between Frequentist & Bayeisan Approaches

Some of you received the Frequentist analysis, while others received the Bayesian analysis. With the remainder of class time, separate into groups of 2-3 people, where each group should have at least 1 person who did the Frequentist analysis and 1 person who did the Bayesian analysis. Discuss the following:

## Conceptual Discussion/Debate

Ideas we can build on:

- How do our modeling choices affect our outcomes of interest based on the assumptions we know about both approaches? Are the results for our hypotheses different?
- How do we interpret the coefficients ($\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$) in both the Frequentist and Bayesian models?
- How might we improve our model based on what we know from our **model summaries** and **general inference** for both approaches?
