## Context

  a. File: 00-context.qmd
  b. Aims: Explore in 5E model. Introduce students to data they will be using in activities and get them thinking about potential questions they may ask of/answer with the data using statistical inference
  c. Cadence: Instructor walks through context document and discusses each section with them


## Activity Introduction
  a. Files: 01-introduction-qmd, 03-one-pager.qmd
  b. Aims: Engage and Explain in 5E model. Introduce students to statistical inference broadly defined, the learning objectives for the activity, and the high-level critical differences in frequentist/Bayesian approaches 
  c. Cadence: Instructor walks them through first sections with introduction/LO's and then provides warmup questions (7-10 minutes of discussion time among groups). Groups can share what they know and instructor shares high-level one pager document on differences between statistical inference paradigms. Instructor then finishes discussion with sections on research questions and hypotheses. 


## Activity
  a. Files:
  b. Aims: Elaborate in 5E model.
  c. Cadence:


## Activity Closing
  a. File: 04-conclusion-qmd
  b. Aims: Evaluate in 5E model. 
  c. Cadence:  Instructor facilitates a group discussion and comparison of frequentist/Bayesian approaches. Carefully engineer a controversy to further engage students, and to highlight the importance of assumptions to statistical conclusions.

TODO
- (SL) Review activity braindumps, articulate the big pieces in this ROS doc, suggest edits
- (ZDR) Review LO's, add instructor details, suggest edits
