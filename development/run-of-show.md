### Context

  a. __File__: `00-context-main.qmd`
  b. __Aims__: _Explore in 5E model_. Introduce students to data they will be using in activities and get them thinking about potential questions they may ask of/answer with the data using methods of statistical inference
  c. __Cadence__: Instructor walks through context document and discusses each section with them, focusing on the trends in the data


### Activity Introduction
  a. __Files__: 
      - Instructor-facing: `01-introduction.qmd`, `03-one-pager.qmd`
      - Student-facing: `01-introduction.qmd`,`03-simplified-main.qmd` 
  b. __Aims__: _Engage and Explain in 5E model_. Introduce students to statistical inference broadly defined, the learning objectives for the activity, and the high-level critical differences in Frequentist/Bayesian approaches 
  c. __Cadence__: Instructor walks them through first sections with introduction/LO's and then provides warmup questions (7-10 minutes of discussion time among groups). Groups can share what they know and instructor shares high-level one pager document on differences between statistical inference paradigms. Instructor then finishes discussion with sections on research questions and hypotheses


### Activity
  a. __Files__: `02a-activity-freq-main.qmd`, `02b-activity-bayes-main.qmd`
  b. __Aims__: _Elaborate in 5E model._ Apply the concepts covered in introduction and one-pager. Depending on which analysis they received, groups should be able to assess and synthesize output from models and make conclusions related to the research question and hypotheses.  
  c. __Cadence__: Instructor introduces completed applied activities to groups (each group receives either Frequentist or Bayesian analysis). Groups use Tables 3 (Model Summaries) and 4 (General Inference) from critical differences one-pager to synthesize results. Focus will be on:
      - Model summaries:
        - Assess Estimates (point estimates for Frequentists / means, quantiles for Bayesians)
        - Assess confidence (CIs for Frequentists / posterior distribution for Bayesians)
      - General inference: 
        - Assess predictions (predicted values for Frequentists / posterior predictions for Bayesians)
        - Assess results relative to null: does this support our claims (research Q/hypothesis)?


### Activity Closing
  a. __Files__: 
      - Instructor-facing:`04-conclusion.qmd`, `03-one-pager.qmd`
      - Student-facing: `04-conclusion.qmd`, `03-simplified-main.qmd`
  b. __Aims__: _Evaluate in 5E model_. Students should be able to articulate, through debate/discussion, the differences between the approaches. Highlight difference in starting assumptions and conclusions, despite groups using the same data
  c. __Cadence__:  Instructor facilitates a group discussion and comparison of Frequentist/Bayesian approaches. Carefully engineer a controversy to further engage students, and highlight the importance of assumptions to statistical conclusions using the critical differences one-pager as a guide.

TO DO

* create post activity survey, which will be an artifact associated with the conclusion
