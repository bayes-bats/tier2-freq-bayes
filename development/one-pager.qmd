## Overview

Below is a reference guide for the critical differences between Bayesians and frequentist. 

- @tbl-fixed illustrates the differences in thinking between fixed variables
- @tbl-prob illustrates the differences in thinking on how to interpret probabilities
- @tbl-summ illustrates the differences in how to summarize models
- @tbl-inf illustrates the differences in thinking on general inference 
- @tbl-qual illustrates the differences in assessing model performance
