## Survey Design^[The instrument draft relies heavily on the sample post-pre survey developed by @kanevsky2014post.]

This survey is designed to gauge where you believe your understanding of different approaches in inferential statistics was before beginning the activity to where it is after completing the activity. The items in the survey ask you to consider where you think you were before the activity, followed by where you think you are now. You will give yourself two ratings to capture this before and after reflection.

**STEPS:**

1. Think about how well you believe you understood inferential statistics approaches before the activity began.
2. Give yourself a score based on @tbl-understand below to capture this understanding.
3. Think about how well you believe you understand inferential statistics approaches after the completion of the activity. 
4. Give yourself a score based on @tbl-understand below to capture this understanding. 

| Score | Meaning | 
|:-------------:|----------|
| 0 | not adequate |
| 1 | not really adequate, but almost okay |
| 2 | adequate, but just barely (still okay otherwise score it 0 or 1) |
| 3 | somewhere between minimally okay and excellent |
| 4 | excellent |

The Understanding Score Table looks like this graphically:

The following example survey has three parts: first and in the farthest left-hand column represents the type of change related to your _competency_ in inferential statistics approaches. _Competency_ refers to changes in knowledge, or what you know, as well as changes in skill level, or what you can do. The second and middle column indicates your understanding using @tbl-understand before you started the activity. You will put a check mark in whatever box best represents your understanding <ins>before</ins> you did the activity. The third and final column indicates your understanding using @tbl-understand after you completed the activity. You will put a check mark in whatever box best represents your understanding <ins>after</ins> you completed the activity. Recall the figure above, where scores of 0 and 1 capture an understanding that is "not okay" and scores of 2, 3, and 4 generally capture an okay understanding.

Please feel free to ask questions if you need clarification on what the survey is asking. Once you have completed the survey, please return it to your instructor. Thank you!

::: {.callout-note icon=false title="Instructor Notes: Post-Pre Survey"}
  

- This is a post-pre survey design, so it is meant to be administered at the end of the activity
- The idea is to capture _changes in competence_ (e.g., changes in what students know and are able to do), which is based on research from @hiebert2014power
- Relying on 5E Model Approach [@elby2010epistemological] to achieve change
- Updates will be made to measure competencies specific to the activity.
- Topics to cover:
  - EDA - something on assessing initial distributions/trends (? what might they say about the larger population? Are they unusual relative to what we might expect? Interesting patterns?) (LO #2?)
  - General inference - something about making generalizations about a larger population using samples of data (LO #1/3)
  - General inference - something specific about assumptions for Frequentists/Bayesians (fixed vs. random parameters)(LO #3)
  - Models - something about why we use them (e.g., uncertainty) (LO #3)
  - Model summaries - something about differences between two approaches (point estimates vs. posterior distribution?)(LO #3)
  - Model summaries - something about research Q/hypothesis (e.g., did it conform to your initial expectations? Open ended response on what they (think they) found? etc.) (LO #1/2)
